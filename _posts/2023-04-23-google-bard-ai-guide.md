## What is Google Bard AI ?

> Technology has been growing at an exponential pace in the last few years, and AI is at the forefront of this innovation. Google Bard AI is one of the greatest innovations to change the way we use and interact with technology

Google introduced [Bard AI](https://bard.google.com/) which is an AI-powered chatbot where we can interact with AI just
like humans talk. It leverages the concept of generative AI which can create new content of various types based on the
data it learnt from the training. Bard AI is built on Google's Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) and is
capable of holding fluid, multi-turn conversations on a variety of topics. With Bard, users can collaborate with AI to
supercharge their imagination, boost productivity, and bring their ideas to life.

Bard AI can simplify your workflows by automating repetitive tasks, providing quick access to information, and assist
you in decision making. For instance, if you are a content creator, you can use Bard AI to brainstorm blog post ideas,
generate summaries or even write full stories. 

Another way Bard AI can help is by providing quick access to information and solve problems. For example, if you are a
software developer, you can use [Bard AI to write code](https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/) , look up
code snippets, explain complex concepts, debug your code. This helps you to work more efficiently and effectively.

In addition, Bard AI can assist you in decision making. For instance, if you are planning a trip, you can ask Bard AI to
advice you compare different destinations, create a list of todos, create a budget, and even plan your itinerary. This
ensures that you make informed decisions and have a smooth travel experience.

Use cases of Bard are endless. In this article, we will explore details of Bard and various ways in which Bard can simplify
workflows and provide you with over 200 prompts across 20+ categories to help you make the most of this powerful tool.

Alright let dive right in!

## How to use Bard AI

* To access Bard, go to [https://bard.google.com/](https://bard.google.com/). Note that Bard is still in experimental
phase and is being released to public in phases. Right now Google released this to US and UK customers in US English
language and is planning to expand to more countries and languages. You can add yourself to waitlist if you don't have access yet. 
* Once you are out of waitlist and have access to Bard, you will see a clean interface like below.
<img src="/assets/images/bard-main-page.png" class="img-fluid"/>
* As you can see, it has a user interface similar to a chatbot. You can chat with Bard just like you speak with your friend. 
* A prompt is like a question or task or conversation that you can use to interact with Bard. Prompt Engineering is one
  of the recent Job profiles that gained light after AI chatbots. Example of a prompt can be: _Draft a packing list for
  my weekend fishing and camping trip_
* Once you enter your prompt you should see response from Bard within few seconds. 
* You can respond to that response and continue your conversation. Currently, Bard’s ability to hold context is
  purposefully limited for now. As Bard continues to learn, its ability to hold context during longer conversations will
  improve.
* Since Bard is still in learning phase, you can provide feedback to Bard either as `Good Response`, `Bad Response` or
  you can even ask to generate `New Response` for the previous question using the buttons shown below. <img src="/assets/images/bard-feedback.png" class="img-fluid"/>

* If you need relevant Search related topics for your prompt, you can press `Google it` button which gives list of
  topics similar to your prompt
* In addition, on the left side navigation, there are other options like `Reset chat` (to reset your ongoing chat) , 
`Bard Activity` (to view the history of all the chats you had with Bard).  

## What makes Bard unique ?

Recent developments in generative AI has given birth to many other chatbots like Bard AI. All these technologies
including Bard AI have the ability to quickly learn and generate new content with minimal information. As much as
generative AI it has advantages, there are disadvantages as well in terms of safety and privacy of these systems. Bard
AI clearly differentiates from others in this aspect as Google is commited and taking
a [responsible AI approach](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/)
to improve these systems. While the experiments are still in progress, you can expect Bard to evolve as more safe and
secure to use AI system than others.

Other unique feature of Bard is that it can connect to internet and Google search. So Bard can keep itself continuously
updated with the latest information. For example, you can ask Bard to give info on _what is the weather like in San
Francisco today_, and it can get the fresh information on the fly.

## Tips & Tricks to master Bard AI prompts:

it as a resource to learn new skills.

#### Collaborate with Bard
Bard is designed to be a collaborative tool, so use it to brainstorm ideas, write stories, or
create music. You might be surprised at the results!

#### Review Bard's responses
While Bard is designed to provide accurate and helpful responses, it's still important to
review its output for accuracy and relevancy.

#### Provide feedback
As an experimental AI, Bard is constantly learning and improving. If you have feedback on Bard's
